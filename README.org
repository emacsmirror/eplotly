#+TITLE: eplotly manual

This minor mode allows Emacs users to create plots directly from elisp
files, without the need for external programs such as R or gnuplot.
It is a simple (and limited in scope) wrapper around [[https://plotly.com/][Plotly]].

The main workhorse is the ~eplotly~ function, which translates
a lisp list into a javascript element, then embeds it into an HTML
file and opens it in a browser: users already familiar with ~Plotly~
might prefer to use this function.

The following utility functions can also be used in place of ~eplotly~
to create common graphs (they assume some default parameters, thus
simplify the instructions to build plots):

 - [[Dotcharts][~eplotly-dot~]] :: for dotcharts
 - [[Barcharts][~eplotly-bar~]] :: for barcharts
 - [[Piechart][~eplotly-pie~]] :: for pie charts
 - [[Histograms][~eplotly-hist~]] :: for histograms
 - [[Heatmap][~eplotly-heatmap~]] :: for heatmaps
 - [[Boxplots][~eplotly-box~]] :: for boxplots
 - [[Curves][~eplotly-fun~]] :: for plotting curves




* Installation


Place eplotly.el somewhere where Emacs can find it (i.e. it must
be in your load-path), then in .emacs write

(require 'eplotly)

From now on, whenever you are in an elisp file, just do
M-x eplotly-mode and you are able to use its plotting functions.


To make the plot creation faster (and to be able to create plots
when you are not connected to the Internet), we suggest to download
locally a copy of plotly.js, i.e. something like the following:

1. Get plotly.js from https://plotly.com/javascript/getting-started/
   (see the "Download" paragraph) and store it somewere in
   your machine.
2. Set the variable *plotly-dir* equal to the path of the
   directory where you've downloaded the plotly.min.js file, e.g.
   write in your ~.emacs~ something like

   #+begin_src elisp
     (setq eplotly-dir "/path/to/plotlyjs/")
   #+end_src


* Usage - simple plots

** Dotcharts <<Dotcharts>>

   You can plot a dotchart via the ~eplotly-dot~ function: it accepts one or
   more arguments:

    - the first one is a list of one or more lists; each nested list contain
      the data to plot, plus addition parameters (see examples)
    - the rest of the arguments are in the form of :keys and contain parameters
      for the chart layout.


    Eg. to plot a series of dots, simply pass a list whose car contains
    2 lists, the first one containing the values of the x-coordinates of
    the dots, the second one containing the y-values.
   #+begin_src elisp

     (eplotly-dot
      '(((1 2 3 4)
         (10 11 12 13))))

   #+end_src

   Suppose we want to add a second series of dots, simply add another
   nested list with x and y values to the data-series.
   #+begin_src elisp

     (eplotly-dot
      '(
        ((1 2 3 4)
         (10 11 12 13))

        ((1 2 3 4)
         (15 15 15 15))
        ))
   #+end_src

   For each series we can customize various some parameters (these parameters try to
   follow the same names used in Plotly). If we want to plot a line that passes
   through the dots, we should pass the value "lines" to the key :mode


   #+begin_src elisp
          (eplotly-dot
           '(((1 2 3 4)
              (10 11 12 13)
             :mode "lines")))
   #+end_src
   

   To plot both dots and line, just use :mode "lines+markers":


   #+begin_src elisp

               (eplotly-dot
                '(((1 2 3 4)
                   (10 11 12 13)
                  :mode "lines+markers"
                  )))
   #+end_src

  The following are some of the keys that you can use for each data seris:

  - :name :: name of the series
  - :size :: size of the dots; if a single number is passed, that will be
    used for all dots; if a list of values is passed, those will be used as
    size for every single plot (in this case, make sure that you pass a size
    value for every single plot, i.e. the lenght of the :size list should be
    the same as the lenght of the x and y values).
  - :color :: like :size, you can pass a single value (either a color name or a
    string represening rgb values - see examples) that will be used for all points
    or a series of colors, one for each point.
  - :symbol :: the symbol to be used to represent the dots.
    

  To set the title of the chart, you can set the keyword :title (Nota Bene:
  this has to be set 'outside' the list of data series - please note the
  parenthesis in the following examples):
  
   #+begin_src elisp

     (eplotly-dot
      '(
        ;; first series of data to plot
        ((1 2 3) (3 3 3) :mode "markers"
         :size (20 30 40) :color "blue")
        ;; second series
        ((1 2 3) (5 2 1) :mode "lines" :text '("A" "B" "C"))
        ;; third series
        ((1 2 3) (5 5 8) :mode "lines+markers" :name "Team C" :size 20))
      ;; layout parameters
      :title "My first plots"
     :xlim '(0 4) :ylim '(0 10))

   #+end_src

   You can also customize the color and the shape of each dot in a data-series
   via the :color and :symbol keys.

  #+begin_src elisp

    (eplotly-dot
     '(((1 2 3 4)
        (10 11 12 13)
        :size (10 20 30 30)
        :color ("rgb(93 164 214)" "rgb(255 144 14)"  "rgb(44 160 101)" "rgb(255 65 54)")
        :symbol  ("circle" "square" "diamond" "cross")))

     :title "Using eplotly-dot elisp function")
  #+end_src

  
** Barcharts <<Barcharts>>

  To create a barchart you need to pass lists of data for every series of bars.
  Each series should be composed of:

  - a first list of labels for each bar
  - a second list of values representing the height of each bar
  - (optional) name of the series (set via the :name key)

  Then - after the data series - we can also pass the following values:

  - :barmode :: if set to "stack", the bars are stacked
  - :title :: title of the chart


  #+begin_src elisp
    (eplotly-bar '(
                ;; first series of bars
                (
                 ;; series of labels for the bars
                 ("giraffes" "orangutans" "monkeys")
                 ;; height of the bars
                 (20 14 23)
                 ;; name of the series
                 :name "SF Zoo")
                ;; second series od bars
                (("giraffes" "orangutans" "monkeys")
                 (12 18 29)
                 :name "LA Zoo"))
              :barmode  "stack"
              :title "Simple Barcharts")
  #+end_src
  

  You can also add text to each bar via the :text keyword:

  #+begin_src elisp

    (eplotly-bar '((
                 ("Liam" "Sophie" "Jacob" "Mia" "William" "Olivia")
                 (8.0 8.0 12.0 12.0 13.0 20.0)
                 :text  ("4.17 below the mean" "4.17 below the mean" "0.17 below the mean" "0.17 below the mean" "0.83 above the mean" "7.83 above the mean"))
                ))
  #+end_src

  The angle of the text at the tick marks can be rotated via the :tickangle parameter:

  #+begin_src elisp
    (eplotly-bar  '((("Liam" "Sophie" "Jacob" "Mia" "William" "Olivia")
              (8.0 8.0 12.0 12.0 13.0 20.0)
              :text  (8.0 8.0 12.0 12.0 13.0 20.0)))
           :tickangle -45)
  #+end_src
  

** Piechart <<Piechart>>

  To create a simple pie chart, pass a data series whose elements
  are

  - values for each slice of the piechart
  - labels for each slice of the piechart

#+begin_src elisp
  (eplotly-pie
      '(
        ((30 20 50)
         ("Residential" "Non-Residential" "Utility")
         )))
#+end_src


  To create a doughnut chart, simply include the additiona parameter
  'hole in the alist (its value should be comprised between
  0 and 1):

#+begin_src elisp
   (eplotly-pie
       '(
         ((16 15 12 6 5 4 42)
          ("US" "China" "European Union" "Russian Federation"
                     "Brazil" "India" "Rest of World" )
          :hole .7
          :name "GHG Emissions")
          ))


#+end_src


** Heatmap <<Heatmap>>

  To build a heatmap you need to pass an alist with car equal to 'z and cdr equal to a
  a nested list built according to the following criteria:

  - each nested list contains the data of a row (first nested list represents
    the first row at the bottom of the heatmap, the last nested list represents
    the row at the top of the heatmap).
  - Each value in each nested list represents the value of a cell of the
     heatmap (cells are represented from left to right)

    I.e. to obtain the following heatmap

    
    | 1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |
    | 5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |
    | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |

    you should use the following nested list:

    '((9 10 11 12) (5 6 7 8) (1 2 3 4))


    #+begin_src elisp
      
  (eplotly-heatmap
          '((
             ((1 20 30 50 1) (20 1 60 80 30) (30 60 1 -10 20)))))

    #+end_src

    If you want to add labels to the x and y axis, just set the
    :x and :y parameters with list containing the labels (pay
    attention to the lenght of each list, which should correspond
    to the size of the heatmap, i.e. the length of the :x list should
    be equal to the number of columnts of the map, while the
    length of the :y list should be equal to the number of rows):

#+begin_src elisp

  (eplotly-heatmap
   '((
      ((1 20 30 50 1) (20 1 60 80 30) (30 60 1 -10 20))
      :x ("Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" "Thursday" "Friday")
      :y ("Morning" "Afternoon" "Evening"))))
#+end_src


** Histograms <<Histograms>>

 To plot histograms you can use the function ~eplotly-hist~
 
#+begin_src elisp
  (eplotly-hist
   '(((1 2 2 2 1 1 1 4 4 4)
      )))
#+end_src

  By default the bars are plotted vertically; to have horizontal
  bars, set the key :direction to "horizontal";
  
#+begin_src elisp
  (eplotly-hist
   '(((1 2 2 2 1 1 1 4 4 4)
      :direction "horizontal"
      )))

#+end_src

  For a stacked histogram, pass two or more series as a first argument,
  then, then pass the :barmode key set to "stack".
  
#+begin_src elisp
  (eplotly-hist
   '(((1 2 2 2 1 1 1 4 4 4))
     ((3 3 2  1 1 1 5 5 5 )))
   :barmode "stack")
#+end_src


** Boxplots <<Boxplots>>


For vertical boxplots, pass lists of data for each box


#+begin_src elisp

  (eplotly-box
   '((
      (1 2 2 2 1 1 1 4 4 4 10 -5))
     ((3 3 2  1 1 1 5 5 5 ))))

#+end_src

You can specify the names of each box, by using the :name key

#+begin_src elisp

      (eplotly-box
       '((
          (1 2 2 2 1 1 1 4 4 4 10 -5)
          :name "first")
         ((3 3 2  1 1 1 5 5 5 )
          :name "second")))

#+end_src


For horizontal boxplots, set the :direction key to "horizontal"

#+begin_src elisp

            (eplotly-box
             '((
                (1 2 2 2 1 1 1 4 4 4 10 -5)
                :name "first"
                :direction "horizontal")
               ((3 3 2  1 1 1 5 5 5 )
                :name "second"
                :direction "horizontal"))
             )

#+end_src



*Grouped boxplots*: for grouped boxplots it is more convenient to
use the *simplot* function (see [[Create boxplots]] paragraph)


** Curves <<Curves>>

  You can plot curves using the ~eplotly-fun~ and passing one or more function
  definitions.

  For each curve the following parameters should be provided:

  
- a function to plot; this can be the name of a function already
  available or a lambda function (NOTA BENE: if you pass a lambda,
  that should not quoted nor be preceeded by #' (i.e.
         (lambda(x)(+ x 2) : is good
       #'(lambda(x)(+ x 2) : is bad
        '(lambda(x)(+ x 2) : is bad
- minimum value for the x-value of the function
- maximum value for the x-value of the function
- :step (optional) : distance between one dot and the next (the smaller this
   value, the smoother the curve will appear). By default
   this is set to 1/20 of the range between xmin and xmax.
- :color (optional): color of the curve
- :dash : can either be 'solid', 'dash', 'dot' or 'dashdot'
- :width: width of the line
- :name : name of the curve
- :mode: default to 'lines' in order to plot a line


 E.g. let's play a parabola with equation $y = 3 x^2 + 5 * x$ from -10 to 10:

  #+begin_src elisp

    (eplotly-fun
     '(
       ((lambda(x)  (+ (* 3 x x) (* 5 x))) -10 10)))
  #+end_src

  ..let's add a line ($y = 10 * x + 3$) in green color and dotted line:

  #+begin_src elisp
    (eplotly-fun
     '(
       ((lambda(x)  (+ (* 3 x x) (* 5 x))) -10 10 :name "Parabola")
       ((lambda(x)  (+ (* 10 x) 3)) -10 10 :color "green"
        :dash "dot" :name "Line")
        )
       )
  #+end_src


  Let's try a more complex example: we want to plot the parabola
  $y = 3 * x^2 + 5 * x$ and its tangent lines at points with x=-5
  and x=3.

  Let's define the following functions:

  #+begin_src elisp

    (defun parabola(x)
      "Our parabola"
      (+ (* 3 x x) (* 5 x)))

    (defun parabola-deriv(x)
      "The derivative of our parabola."
      (+ (* 6 x) 5))

    (defun tangent-at(fun fun-deriv val)
      "Return the tangent line of FUN at VAL point.
    "
      (let*
          (
           ;; Px is the x-value at which we want to find
           ;; the tangent line
           (Px val)
           ;; Py is the value of function at Px
           (Py (funcall fun Px))
           ;; m is the slope of the tangent
           ;; curve at Px
           (m (funcall fun-deriv val))
           ;; b is the intercept of the
           ;; tangent curve at Px
           (b (- Py (* m Px)))
           )
        `(lambda(z)(+ (* ,m z) ,b))))
  #+end_src

    We can now plot the parabola and the 2 tangent curves:

    #+begin_src elisp
      (let*
          ((xmin -10)
           (xmax 10))

        (eplotly-fun `(
                       ;; plot the parabola
                       (parabola ,xmin ,xmax :color "red" :name "parabola" :dash "solid")
                       ;; plot the tangen at x=3
                       (,(tangent-at #'parabola #'parabola-deriv 3) ,xmin ,xmax
                        :color "green" :name "Tangent at 3" :dash "dash")
                       ;; plot the tangent at -5
                       (,(tangent-at #'parabola #'parabola-deriv -5) ,xmin ,xmax
                        :color "blue" :name "Tangent at -5" :dash "dash")
                       ;; let's plot the tangent points
                       (parabola 3 3 :mode "markers" :name "Tangent point at 3" :color "green")
                       (parabola -5 -5 :mode "markers" :name "Tangent point at -5"
                                 :color "blue")
                       )
                     :title "Parabola and some tangents"
;;      :ylim '(-10 80)
        ))
    #+end_src

    Please note the following:

    - the nested list passed to eplotly-fun is /backquoted/ so that the
      calls to ~tangent-at~ can be evaluated via the "," which is
      prepended to them
    - We used a little trick to plot the dots:
      - the parabola function was passes (so that it automatically
        gets the right y value)
      - the range of the parabola is limited to the point we want
        to plot (i.e. "from 3 to 3" or "from -5 to -5)
      - we pass the argument :mode "markers" so that dots are
        plotted instead of lines.


    
** Densitymaps

In the case of densitymap, all parameters passed for the plots are in
the form of key/value(s); the following parameters are accepted:


- LON: list or vector of longitude values
- LAT: list or vector of latitude values
- Z: list or vector of values for each lat/lon point
- NAME: name of the curve
- MODE: default to 'densitymap' in order to plot a line
- TEXT: text associated to the series
- RADIUS: radius for the densitymap plot
- YANCHOR: where should the legendbar be shown
- LEN: length of the legendbar"

  
#+begin_src elisp

 (eplotly-densitymap
  '((:lon [10 20 30] :lat [15 25 30] :z [1 2 3])
    (:lon [25 35 45 ] :lat [5 10 20] :z [1 2 3]))
   :coloraxis  '((colorscale . "Viridis")))  
#+end_src


** Combining charts

  You can combine different charts using ~eplotly-combine~, which accepts the
  following arguments:

  - a nested list of various eplotly plotting functions
  - a series of layout parameters.


  Eg, suppose we want to combine the followig charts:

   - some functions (e.g. the parabola and and tangent drawn in a previous
     paragraph; please load the code chunks in [[Curves][Curves paragraph]] to run this
     example, since you will need a few functions defined there)
   - some dots, created via the eplotly-dot functions
   - some shapes (i.e. a circle and a rectangle).

  We could wrap all these function calls into a list and then pass it to the
  ~eplotly-combine~ function like in the following example:

  #+begin_src elisp
    (eplotly-combine
 
 `(
   (eplotly-fun (  
		 ((lambda(x)(+ (* 3 x x) (* 5 x))) -10 10 :color "red" :name "parabola" :dash "solid")
		 (,(tangent-at #'parabola #'parabola-deriv 3) -10 10
		  :color "green" :name "Tangent at 3" :dash "dash")
		 (parabola 3 3 :mode "markers" :name "Tangent point at 3" :color "green")
		 (parabola -5 -5 :mode "markers" :name "Tangent point at -5"
			   :color "blue")
		 )
		;; (boh 0 100 :dash "dot" :color "blue" :mode "markers")
		:title "Parabola and some tangents")

   (eplotly-dot
    (([-8 -4 0 4 8] [20 20 20 20 20 ]
      :name "Some points")))

   (eplotly-shapes
    ((
      :type "circle"
      :xref "x" 
      :yref "y" 
      :x0 -7; "2015-02-04" 
      :y0 40 
      :x1 -3;"2015-02-06" 
      :y1 60 
      :fillcolor "#d3d3d3" 
      :opacity 0.2)

     (
      :xref "x" 
      :yref "y" 
      :x0 1; "2015-02-04" 
      :y0 15 
      :x1 5;"2015-02-06" 
      :y1 80 
      :fillcolor "#d3d3d3"
      ;; :label ((text . "prova"))
      :text "My shape"
      ;; :textposition "end"
      :fontsize 20
      :opacity 0.2)
     )
    :name "some rectangles"))
 )
  #+end_src




* More complex graphs via ~eplotly~

  The above mentioned functions are just wrappers for the function ~eplotly~
  which can be used to create more complicated plots and allows for additional
  fine tunings of those plots.


  This function accepts 2 arguments:
  1. the first is a series of one or more alists; each alist follows the structure
     of the javascript code used by plotly.js; heare are some example of its usage
      (please refer to the potly javascript documentation to see all the avaiable

** Create boxplots <<Create boxplots>>


For vertical boxplots, pass alists with car equal to 'y and 'type equal to "box":

#+begin_src elisp

  (eplotly
   '(((y . (1 2 2 2 1 1 1 4 4 4 10 -5))
      (type . "box"))
     ((y . (3 3 2  1 1 1 5 5 5 ))
      (type . "box"))))

#+end_src

For horizontal boxplots, use 'x instead of 'y in the data-series
nested list.

#+begin_src elisp

  (eplotly
   '(((x . (1 2 2 2 1 1 1 4 4 4 10 -5))
      (type . "box"))
     ((x . (3 3 2  1 1 1 5 5 5 ))
      (type . "box"))))

#+end_src

Let's create a plot similar to the one in Plotly-javascript tutorial:

#+begin_src elisp
    (defun random-list(n upper-limit)
      "Convenience function to create a list
  of random numbers."
      (let*
          ((res '()))
        (dotimes (x n)
          (push (random upper-limit) res))
        (reverse res))
      )

    (eplotly
     `(((y . ,(random-list 30 10))
        (type . "box"))
       ((y . ,(random-list 30 11))
        (type . "box"))))

#+end_src

    To include the underlying dots, add:

    - (boxpoints . "all")
    - (jitter . 0.3)
    - (pointpos . -1.8)

      to the data series (of course these are just the same values
      used in the javascript tutorial, you are supposed to use the
      most appropriate values for your plot).

#+begin_src elisp

  (eplotly
   '(((y . (1 2 2 2 1 1 1 4 4 4 10 -5))

      (boxpoints . "all")
      (jitter . 0.3)
      (pointpos . -1.8)
      (type . "box"))
     ((y . (3 3 2  1 1 1 5 5 5 ))
      (type . "box"))))

#+end_src


*Grouped boxplots*: for each data series, pass both y values (the data
from which the box should be built) and x values (labels that represent
the group to which each y-value belongs to).

#+begin_src elisp
  (setq days
        '("day 1" "day 1" "day 1" "day 1" "day 1" "day 1"

           "day 2" "day 2" "day 2" "day 2" "day 2" "day 2"))


  (eplotly
   `((
      (y . [0.2 0.2 0.6 1.0 0.5 0.4 0.2 0.7 0.9 0.1 0.5 0.3])
      (x . ,days)
      (name . "kale")
      ;; marker: {color: "#3D9970"}
      (type . "box"))
     ((y . [0.6 0.7 0.3 0.6 0.0 0.5 0.7 0.9 0.5 0.8 0.7 0.2])
      (x . ,days)
      (name . "radishes")
      ;; marker: {color: "#FF4136"}
      (type . "box")
      )
     (
      (y . [0.1 0.3 0.1 0.9 0.6 0.6 0.9 1.0 0.3 0.6 0.8 0.5])

      ;; marker: {color: "#FF851B"}
      (type . "box")))

* Subplots

  You need to pass a second argument to the eplotly function (an
  alist containing the layout parameters) where you need to set
  the number of rows and columns, i.e. something like the
  following will create a 2*2 grid of charts

   '(( grid .
       ((rows . 2)
        (columns . 2)
        (pattern .  "independent"))))

#+begin_src elisp
  (eplotly
   '((
      (  x . [1 2 3])
      (  y . [4 5 6])
      (type . "scatter"))
     ((x . [20 30 40])
      (y . [50 60 70])
      (xaxis . "x2")
      (yaxis . "y2")
      (type . "scatter"))
     (
      (x . [300 400 500])
      (y . [600 700 800])
      (xaxis . "x3")
      (yaxis . "y3")
      (type . "scatter"))
     (
      (x . [4000 5000 6000])
      (y . [7000 8000 9000])
      (xaxis . "x4")
      (yaxis . "y4")
      (type . "scatter")
